# Set Me Up - Branch Setup Software (internal use)

This is a project is intended to help the Visualization district set up and compile branches. Although it uses SVN commands and some internal routines such as 'vis s' and 'vis mlldamt', it is totally adjustable to whichever source control software you use on your personal or professional workspace. The language of choice will be Java in order to make use of the swing API, and pure OO programming.
