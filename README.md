This project is intended to assist the Visualization district set up and compile branches. Although it uses SVN commands and some internal routines such as 'vis s' and 'vis mlldamt', it is totally adjustable to whichever source control software you use on your personal or professional workspace. The language of choice is Java, and uses the Swing graphics interface library.
