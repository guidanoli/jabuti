# Set Me Up - Branch Setup Software (internal use)

This is a project that intends to ease the pain that is to set up branches.
It is for internal use since it uses certain commands that are specific to
where I work on. Such as 'vis s' and 'vis mlldamt'.

The language of choice will be Java in order to make use of the swing API,
and OO programming.
